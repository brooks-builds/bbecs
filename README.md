# Brooks Builds Entity Component System

This Entity Component System is loosely based on HECS but is build from scratch to be used with projects built on Brooks Builds. You can watch the [live-streams](https://www.twitch.tv/brookzerker) or [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT1-XRVnJA-wws2bfbLbFcQ).

This ECS is meant to be a learning project, to understand the how and why of ECS by building one from scratch. If you are building a commercial project, then it is recommended that you check out one of the excellent ECS libraries like [HECS](https://crates.io/crates/hecs) or [SPECS](https://crates.io/crates/specs) available on [crates.io](https://crates.io).
